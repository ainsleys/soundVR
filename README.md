# WebVR Boilerplate-sound

This WIP starts from [borismus's][borisumusgit] boilerplate. We are attempting to incorporate webrtc audio annotation in 3D navigable environment using [THREE.js][three].-based starting point for VR experiences that work well in
both Google Cardboard and other VR headsets. Also provides a fallback for
experiencing the same content without requiring a VR device.

This project relies heavily on the [webvr-polyfill][polyfill] to provide VR
support if the [WebVR API](spec) is not implemented.
